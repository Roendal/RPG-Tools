h1. RPG Tools 

RPG Tools is a compilation of helpful tools when developing a Role Playing Game (RPG). For now the gem has three classes:

Die: Models the use of a simple die (ie. D6, D10, D20, etc.)
Throw: Takes an array of Die to be rolled and the offset to be added (ie. 2D6, 3D4+5, 2D10,3D20+2, etc.)
CheckRoll: Using a Throw and a threshold models a check roll with one or several chances and some other settings (ie. 2D6 to get greater or equal to 10, 3D10 to get les than 15, etc.)
